                <h2>The Owner</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Noelle! I took my first ceramics class in high school and really struggled.
                    I was determined to succeed, so I came into the school's studio before school, after school, and at lunch until I started figuring it out.
                    I owe much of where I am to a very patient teacher who recognized my desire to learn and helped me get there.
                    By the end of that semester, I actually enjoyed woking with the clay! I decided to take the more advanced class the following year,
                    and was really able to cultivate my talent.<br><br>
                    My freshman year of college I took yet another ceramics class. This one pushed me to do more than I believed I was capable of.
                    I've always loved the process that takes a ball of clay and transforms it into something beautiful and unique. It was in this
                    class I knew I wanted a studio of my own. I spent as much time as possible throwing on the wheel, building by hand, experimenting
                    with glazes, and pushing the limits of what I was capable of. Now, I want to help others recognize their abilities and create their own pieces.
